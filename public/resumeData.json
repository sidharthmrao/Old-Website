    "bio":"Hi! I'm a Junior at Choate Rosemary Hall, a High School located in Wallingford, Connecticut. I'm interested in Computer Science, AI, Engineering, Cyber Security, and Programming, mainly in Python. At school, I am the Field Team Lead, a builder, and a programmer on the choate FRC robotics team and am part of the Advanced Robotics Concentration special program. I'm a cello player in Choate's Concert Orchestra, and outside of classes, I am the Vice President of the Choate Aerospace Association Club. I volunteer at Robotics and Beyond, where I teach students Python, Machine Learning, and Edge Computing. In my free time, I mess around with Rubik's cubes, learn card magic and coin tricks, and develop automated scripts for me to use in my daily life. On this website, you can find more information about me, my accomplishments, programs, and contact me.",
