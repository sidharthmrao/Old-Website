    "bio": "Hi! I'm a Senior at Choate Rosemary Hall, a High School located in Wallingford, Connecticut. I'm interested in Computer Science, AI, Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Programming, mainly in Python. At school, I am the Lead Programmer, and Lead Technician on Choate's FRC robotics team (Wired Boars 7407) and am part of the Advanced Robotics Concentration signature program. I'm a cello player in Choate's Concert Orchestra, and outside of classes, I am the President of the Choate Aerospace Association. I volunteer at Robotics and Beyond, where I teach students Python, Machine Learning, and Edge Computing. In my free time, I mess around with Rubik's cubes, learn card magic and coin tricks, develop automated scripts for me to use in my daily life, and customize my personal Arch Linux based distro.",
